# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
mean_flipper_length = mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Description of dataset

The `penguins` dataset has 344 observations of 8 variables. The eight
variables include species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and year.

It contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is 200.92
mm.

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```
